/* router.js
 *
 * Owns location.hash and nothing else. It does not know what a view is or what
 * any artifact holds. It parses the hash, tells its one listener what the hash
 * now says, and writes the hash when asked. The sibling crack-spread-study's
 * router, unchanged in behaviour.
 *
 * Three shapes of hash, kept apart on purpose:
 *
 *   #/now                         a route: the view name is the first segment
 *   #/now?open=netbacks,flows     a route carrying view state after the question
 *                                 mark, parsed to a plain object of strings, so
 *                                 an open section is linkable
 *   #view-title                   a document fragment, for example the skip
 *                                 link without script. Not a route; reported so
 *                                 the caller keeps the view being read
 *   (empty), #, #/                the default route
 *
 * Which views exist is not decided here. The caller passes the set of known
 * view names to start(). A route to a name outside that set is reported as
 * { kind: "unknown" } with the name typed, so the caller can say what happened
 * instead of silently landing on Now.
 *
 * Numeric literals: none.
